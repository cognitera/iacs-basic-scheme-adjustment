This Ant-based buildsystem is by default using a local file-system-based Ivy repository.
This is located at a subdirectory of the main build system's OTS location.
If, during your development you wish to experiment with some packages and, for some
reason, you don't want to or are unable at the moment to have them installed at OTS
you can enable remote access to the main Maven repository (ibiblio) by placing the
following line in your build-indiv.properties file:

    enable-ibiblio = true
